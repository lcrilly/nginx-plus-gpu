Here’s a flexible self‑guided walking tour that hits York’s main historic areas in a sensible loop, starting and ending at the railway station.

Overview
Distance: about 5–6 km / 3–4 miles.

Time: 2–3 hours walking, 4–6 hours if you linger at sights or visit interiors.

Terrain: mostly flat streets and sections of the city walls with steps.

Step‑by‑step route
York Railway Station → City Walls

Exit the station and walk towards the walls at Station Road; join the walls via the nearby steps.

Follow the wall towards the river for elevated views over the station and rooftops.

Lendal Bridge → Museum Gardens → St Mary’s Abbey

Drop from the walls near Lendal Bridge and cross the River Ouse.
​

Enter Museum Gardens for the Yorkshire Museum and the ruins of St Mary’s Abbey, one of the most atmospheric spots in the city.

York Minster and Medieval Quarter

From Museum Gardens, walk out onto High Petergate to reach York Minster.
​

Do an exterior circuit of the Minster, then continue via Petergate’s narrow medieval streets.
​

Bootham Bar or Monk Bar → Walls section

Re‑join the walls at Bootham Bar or Monk Bar for classic Minster views from height.

Continue along the walls for a stretch, dropping back down towards the Shambles area.

The Shambles and Shambles Market

Walk the Shambles, one of the best‑preserved medieval shopping streets in the UK, then wander through Shambles Market for food or coffee.

Nearby, take a quick look at Merchant Adventurers’ Hall if you like guild history.
​

Clifford’s Tower and Castle Area

Head south to Clifford’s Tower on its mound, the remains of York Castle with panoramic city views from the top.

Around the base you have the Castle Museum and former prison buildings.
​

River Ouse Riverside Stroll

From the castle area, walk back to the Ouse and follow the riverside path (for example towards Skeldergate and Millennium Bridge if you want a longer loop).
​

Enjoy the flat riverside stretch, then loop back via Lendal Bridge towards the station.

Return to York Railway Station

From Lendal Bridge, it’s a short walk up Station Road back to the station.

Optional stops and timing
Inside York Minster: 45–90 minutes if you go in.
​

Yorkshire Museum / Museum Gardens linger time: 30–60 minutes.

Full city‑walls circuit alone: 2–3.4 miles, typically 1.5–2 hours at an easy pace.

If you prefer a ready‑made GPX / map
A 5 km circular “York Minster City Walk” (Minster, Bootham Bar, Shambles, Clifford’s Tower, river, Museum Gardens) matches this route closely and is designed as a self‑guided trail.
​

There are downloadable walls‑walk and full‑city routes starting/ending at the station if you want to follow them on your phone or GPS device.
