A quartz watch uses a battery and a vibrating quartz crystal to create an extremely regular electrical “beat,” then turns that into the familiar ticking of the hands.

Core idea
The battery sends a small current into an electronic circuit that includes a tiny quartz crystal cut like a tuning fork.

Because of the piezoelectric effect, the crystal vibrates at a very stable natural frequency when energized, typically 32,768 times per second.

The circuit counts these vibrations and turns every 32,768th vibration into one precise pulse per second.

From crystal to ticking hands
Each 1‑second pulse drives a small stepping motor, which converts the electrical pulse into a tiny rotational movement.

That motor turns a gear train (dial train), which reduces the speed and moves the second, minute, and hour hands on the dial.

The result is the characteristic one‑tick‑per‑second motion of the second hand in most quartz analog watches.

Why quartz is accurate
Quartz’s vibration frequency is very stable with temperature and time, so the “clock” inside the watch hardly drifts.
​

Since the frequency is a power of two (32,768 = 2^15), the electronics can use a simple chain of divide‑by‑2 stages to derive exactly 1 Hz (one pulse per second) with minimal error.

Digital quartz watches
In a digital quartz watch, the same 1‑second (and higher‑frequency) pulses are used directly by digital counters and a display driver instead of a stepping motor and gears.
​

The display (LCD or LED) shows hours, minutes, and seconds by counting those pulses electronically rather than moving hands.
​

In short: the quartz crystal is the timekeeper, the electronics count its vibrations, and a motor plus gears (or digital counters) turn that into the time you read.
