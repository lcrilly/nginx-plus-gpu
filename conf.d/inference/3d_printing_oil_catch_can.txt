A standard 3D printed container made from common filaments like PLA or PETG is not reliably safe for storing hot engine oil at 100°C; stronger, specialist filaments such as ABS, nylon (PA12), PPS, PEEK, or ULTEM are required for both temperature and chemical resistance.

Filament Material Considerations
ABS: Can withstand up to 100°C and has reasonable oil resistance, making it one of the more accessible FDM filaments for this purpose, though its chemical resistance is not absolute.

Nylon (PA12): Offers excellent resistance to engine oil and high temperatures, used in automotive settings, but is more difficult to print and absorbs water, which may affect integrity over time.

PPS, PEEK, PEKK, ULTEM: These advanced engineering thermoplastics provide superior heat and chemical resistance. They are suitable for prolonged exposure to engine oil at high temperatures, but require industrial printers and are costly.

PETG: Has high oil resistance but its glass transition temperature is around 70-80°C, so it may deform at 100°C and is therefore unsafe for long-term exposure to hot engine oil.

PLA: Chemically resistant but deforms well below 100°C and is not recommended for hot oil applications.

Oil and Chemical Resistance
Materials such as PETG, CF-PETG, PA12, PPS, PEEK, and ULTEM are noted for high oil resistance and minimal swelling or deformation when exposed to engine oil.

Common filaments like PLA absorb oil, may degrade mechanically, and soften when hot; long-term reliability is poor in hot engine oil environments.

Practical Recommendations
For hobbyist and low-end printers, ABS is the minimum viable option, but even then, only for short-term use and with careful monitoring.

Industrial-grade filaments (such as PA12, PPS, PEEK, ULTEM) provide reliable performance, but require specialized equipment to print.

Ensure thick walls, 100% infill, and robust design if using any filament near its operational limits.

Conclusion
For reliable, safe storage of hot engine oil at 100°C in a 3D printed container, avoid consumer-level materials (PLA, PETG). Use ABS for short durations with caution, or opt for high-performance materials—ideally PA12, PPS, PEEK, or ULTEM—for best chemical and thermal resistance.
