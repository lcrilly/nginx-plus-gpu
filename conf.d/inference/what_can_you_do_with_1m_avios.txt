With 1 million Avios you’re realistically looking at roughly £8,000–£12,000 of travel value if you use them well, or about £10,000 if you take a simple “cash‑like” valuation.

Rough value and baselines
Many UK‑focused valuations put Avios around 1.0–1.2p each, implying £10,000–£12,000 of value from 1 million points when used for long‑haul premium cabins.

More conservative, cash‑like calculators come out nearer £10,000 per 1,000,000 Avios (≈1p/point).
​

Generic points calculators that assume good travel redemptions land in the same ballpark (about 1.5–1.7 US cents per Avios).

Concrete things you could do
These are illustrative, not hard limits:

70–80 off‑peak one‑way economy tickets New York–London (or similar distance) on BA.

100+ short‑haul economy segments (US domestic or intra‑Europe) on distance‑based partner pricing at 7,500–9,000 Avios one way.

A big group trip: for example, ~14 people in business class return from the US East Coast to Madrid using Iberia off‑peak rates via Avios transfers.
​

Multiple round‑the‑world or multi‑carrier business‑class itineraries; a basic multi‑carrier round‑the‑world starts from about 200,000 Avios in business.
​

Alternative uses (worse but flexible)
You can cash out via Nectar at a floor value of roughly 0.8p per Avios, i.e. ~£8,000 in supermarket/retail credit for 1 million points (rate varies over time).
​

Hotels, cars and “experiences” via BA/Avios portals are possible but typically give you less than using Avios for long‑haul premium flights.

How to think about “best use”
Use them primarily for long‑haul business or first on BA/oneworld, especially off‑peak and from regions/routes where cash fares are high.

Avoid using Avios for high‑tax/fee redemptions in economy when cash tickets are cheap; the effective pence‑per‑point drops quickly.

If you just want simple, no‑thinking value, treat them as roughly £10k of travel credit and sanity‑check any redemption against that benchmark.
