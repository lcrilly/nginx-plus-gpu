Yes, Denver to Albuquerque is widely considered an excellent road trip, especially if you take a scenic route via southern Colorado and northern New Mexico rather than blasting straight down I‑25.

Why it’s a good trip
The corridor takes you from the Rockies into classic Southwest high desert, so you get varied scenery in a manageable 1–3 day drive.

Typical direct driving time is roughly 6.5–7 hours via I‑25 (about 450–470 miles), but popular scenic variants run 8–10 hours driving spread over a couple of days.

You have multiple “flavours”: fast interstate (I‑25), or slower but more scenic loops via places like Taos, Santa Fe, and Great Sand Dunes National Park.

Main route options
Fastest: I‑25 through Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Trinidad, Raton, Las Vegas (NM), Santa Fe area, then Albuquerque; around 6.5–7 hours without long stops.

Taos / Santa Fe route: Detour off I‑25 to include Taos and Santa Fe; guides quote roughly 465–550 miles and around 8.5–10 hours of wheel‑time, usually done over 2–3 days.

Longer “Colorado loop”: Some itineraries swing west via places like Buena Vista, Ouray, Durango, and even Mesa Verde, pushing the total to 700+ miles and 13+ hours of driving, i.e., a multi‑day Southwest tour.

Notable stops and highlights
In Colorado, common stops include Colorado Springs (Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak area), Cañon City and the Royal Gorge, Pueblo, and Great Sand Dunes National Park (tallest dunes in North America).

In New Mexico, Taos (gorge bridge, art museums, hot springs), Santa Fe (historic plaza, art, food), and then Albuquerque (Old Town, Sandia Peak Tramway, Petroglyph National Monument) are frequently recommended.

Things to consider
Altitude is non‑trivial: Denver, southern Colorado, and much of northern New Mexico are all at high elevation, so some guides suggest at least one night to acclimate if coming from sea level.

Weather can affect mountain stretches, especially in winter; I‑25 is generally more straightforward in bad conditions, while more scenic options (e.g., via US‑285 or high passes) can be slower or more exposed.

If you share time of year, number of days, and whether you prefer quickest or most scenic, a tailored route with specific overnight stops is very doable.
